Sometimes managers and business leaders can back themselves into a corner due to poor structuring.  Putting the blame on a single manager is often simplistic and unfair, as the decisions were most likely made long ago.  The problem can often be solved quite easily by letting employees focus on what they know and what they're passionate about.  Here is an example where a restructuring helped a business succeed:

* Dave is the IT Director at XYZ Corporation, a B2B procurement company.  XYZ houses a large, monolithic legacy application that handles employee payroll and time tracking, client billing, customer relationship management, and internal reporting.  The existing system was designed 10 years ago to aggregate a multitude of Excel spreadsheets and Access databases that were distributed amongst 50 workstations.  While these were often stored in a network folder, oftentimes the files would be completely out of sync and data would be lost permanently.  The obvious business solution was a single source of truth (i.e. a single database).  Dave had originally structured three teams:  Database, Java and Analytics (3-7 members each) to actively develop and maintain this monolith.
* James, one of the Java developers at XYZ, is very skilled in Oracle DB2 (the same technology the system uses).  James, however, is not allowed to touch the database, as that's the job of the database team.  James is passionate about CRM, and is tasked with created new features that will save the business money.  James is often stretched thin, fixing high-priority bugs in the client billing system while juggling new features in the CRM.
* Bill, a database developer and the most senior team member, is skilled at report building.  Bill is deeply aware of current performance bottlenecks and how to avoid them.  Unfortunately Bill is not in the loop on current reporting requirements (because that's not his job).  He doesn't understand what the business needs, and he desperately needs to architect for the future.  Bill is burnt out because he knows in 6 months, everyone is going to be breathing down his neck.
* As the weeks passed, Dave knew that the IT Department was slipping behind and already on track to exceed the quarterly budget.  Sensing morale dipping, Dave's gut reaction was to hire on some fresh developers to accelerate progress on the CRM.  


Instead of continuing down the happy path of hiring more developers, Dave did something unexpected.  Knowing he was over budget, he scrapped the "hire more developers" idea.  He decided it no longer made sense to separate employees by their "skills".


It made more sense to have James and Bill lead their own full-stack teams.  This way, both could maximize their broad swaths of IT knowledge to deliver optimal results.  James was happier because he gets to work exclusively on CRM, and he had the opportunity to apply his DB2 skills.  Bill was fulfilled because he can plan for the future and develop reporting applications that he knew would scale without major problems.  In the end, everyone was satisfied that they could work on projects they were passionate about, and Dave came in under budget.
